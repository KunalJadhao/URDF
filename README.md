My Robot URDF Project

This project contains a Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) model of my custom robot.
It is designed for simulation in ROS 2 with RViz and Gazebo.
The URDF describes the robotâ€™s physical structure, joints, and visual elements for use in virtual testing and development.


ðŸ“Œ Features

    Custom Robot URDF with links, joints, and meshes.

    Visual and collision models for realistic simulation.

    Configured to work with ROS 2 and RViz.

    Gazebo integration for physics-based simulation.
