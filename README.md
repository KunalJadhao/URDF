# 🛠️ My 4-Wheel Robot URDF

A simple **4-wheeled differential drive robot** model created using **URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format) for ROS/ROS2 simulations.  
This robot is designed for use in **RViz** and **Gazebo** for visualization, navigation experiments, and robotics learning.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
````

### 2️⃣ Open in RViz

```bash
ros2 launch urdf_tutorial display.launch.py model:=urdf/my_robot.urdf
```

*(Make sure you have `urdf_tutorial` installed in your ROS2 workspace)*

### 3️⃣ Open in Gazebo

```bash
gazebo urdf/my_robot.urdf
```

*(You may need to convert URDF to SDF for better Gazebo compatibility)*

## ⚙️ Robot Features

* ✅ 4-wheeled differential drive layout
* ✅ Continuous joints for wheel rotation
* ✅ Realistic wheel positions for simulation
* ✅ Uses `base_footprint` for proper localization in ROS
* ✅ Materials and colors for better visualization

## 🖼️ Adding Your Own Screenshots

1. Run the robot in RViz or Gazebo.
2. Take screenshots from **front** and **side** angles.
3. Save them into the `images` folder as `front_view.png` and `side_view.png`.
4. Git will automatically show them in this README.

Example:

```bash
mkdir images
mv ~/Pictures/front_view.png images/
mv ~/Pictures/side_view.png images/
```

---

## 🛠️ Customization

You can modify:

* **Wheel size** → change `radius` and `length` in `<cylinder>`
* **Base size** → edit `<box size="x y z"/>`
* **Colors** → change `<material>` RGBA values
* **Wheel positions** → adjust `xyz` in `<origin>`

If you want, I can also give you **ready-made example images** with a transparent background so your GitHub page looks clean until you take your own screenshots.  

Do you want me to prepare those sample images for you now?
